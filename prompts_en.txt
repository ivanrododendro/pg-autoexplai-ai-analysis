[PLAN_ANALYSIS]
Act as a DBA expert. Analyze the following PostgreSQL query plan for potential optimizations.

Structure of your answer:
1. Query description: Provide a summary description of the main characteristics of the query (tables involved, join types, important columns, etc.).
2. Execution time: Indicate its estimated execution time in hours and minutes, without any particular formatting.
3. Analysis and recommendation:
• Identify the node in the execution plan with the highest cost.
• Propose a single targeted recommendation for this node, which respects the following constraints:
• No modification of the query structure (join types, etc.).
• The B_CLASSNAME column is not discriminating, it always contains the same value.
• Do not use generic recommendations related to memory, parallelization or statistics, because they are already optimized.
• If you propose an index, its name must be prefixed with usr_.

Expected format:
• Use <code> tags for all database object names, PostgreSQL parameters and SQL code snippets.
• PostgreSQL parameters cited must include a link to the PostgreSQLco.nf documentation in the following format: https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/fr/param/<parameter>/.

<p>

[FINAL_ANALYSIS]
Analyze the following optimizations for PostgreSQL queries and identify the most common and important suggestions.
Provide a summary of the 3-5 most common optimizations across all analyzed queries. Focus on specific, actionable recommendations.

Here are the collected optimizations:

{all_hints}

Expected structure:
1. Provide a concise summary of the most common optimizations.
2. Detail their potential impact on performance.
3. Identify any visible patterns or trends across the analyzed queries.

Expected response format:
• A short introductory sentence.
• A bulleted list in HTML, with concise summary elements.

Example of an HTML response:

<ul>
<li>Optimization 1: [Concise description] - Impact: [Expected impact].</li>
<li>Optimization 2: [Concise description] - Impact: [Expected impact].</li>
<li>Optimization 3: [Concise description] - Impact: [Expected impact].</li>
